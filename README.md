                                         Hello There!
                           This is what I've done so far in my Piscine.
                                  My work might not be the best.
                          And I didn't finish every exercise that I got.
                                      But I did my best.
                                     As a new guy to 'C'.
                               As a new guy to programming itself.
                                  I had to learn from scratch.
                        And I'm happy with what I've accomplished so far.
