                                                                                                            Hello There!
                                                                                              This is what I've done so far in my Piscine.
                                                                                                     My work might not be the best.
                                                                                              And I didn't finish ever exercise that I got.
                                                                                                          But I did my best.
                                                                                                          As a new guy to 'C'.
                                                                                                  As a new guy to programming it self.
                                                                                                      I had to learn from scratch.
                                                                                            And I'm happy with what I've accomplished so far.
